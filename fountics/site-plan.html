      <h3>About</h3>

      <h4>Our mission</h4>
      <p>We improve lives through innovative IT solutions. Our partners are mainly startups, and Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs). 
        In addition to that, our social component offers training and internship programs to fight computer illiteracy and promote professional 
        skills development through real-life projects. That said, we target all social layers of the DRC population, including the youth. 
        With this ambitious goal, we anticipate a short-, medium-, and long-term impact on community development at the grassroots level. 
        We believe that youth empowerment will bring a lasting contribution to both reducing poverty and increasing local GDP.
        We create a perfect environment for experimental development with young scholars. They get the opportunity to go beyond their limits 
        while trying to respond to the needs of organizations. Surrounded by experienced mentors, they reduce new technology uncertainties and 
        feel free to produce innovative solutions. To maintain that atmosphere through generations of scientists, we encourage knowledge transfer 
        as one of our best practices.
      </p>

      <h4>Gender equity and equal opportunity</h4>
      <p>We take seriously gender equity and equal opportunity policies. Indeed, knowing the traditional realities that favor men over women, 
        female applicants will be encouraged and protected against abuse and harassment. 
      </p>

      <h4>Environmental aspect</h4>
      <p>The preservation of the environment is intrinsically the essence of this project. Massive mastery of computer tools will indirectly trigger 
        the reduction of deforestation. Data digitizing, associated with process automation, will foster new habits -- local communities will be more 
        prone to use software and renewable energy rather than tree-based products to manage information.</p>
