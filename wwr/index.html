                <p class="home-paragraph-1">
                    We believe that there is nothing more relaxing than rafting. That is why we support to the Dry Oar philosophy of boating. 
                    Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.

                    That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big
