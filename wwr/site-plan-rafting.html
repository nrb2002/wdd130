    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>We promote rafting because it is a more than relaxing leisure game that can turn out to be your hobby! All you need is to try, at least once,
        the feeling of descending portions of rivers' rapids caused by strong currents and possible obstacles to understand what we mean. 
        It must be scary to board a pneumatic boat or steer a raft with a paddle for the first time, but once you start, you can't quit. 
        Given the feeling this sport brings, we believe it is one of the best ways to rejuvenate your mind and stay away from life routine. 
        We want to provide entertainment in a natural environment, away from urban restrictions. We promise that each day you do rafting will bring you a 
        unique experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The site is accessible in all formats: desktop, laptop, and mobile. Soon, our mobile application will be available for free on PlayStore.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Rafting is appropriate for people who like adventure while exploring the wonders of the nature. One of the prerequisites to be met is good 
        swimming  skills. Preferably, we accept adults who are in good physical condition and able to paddle by themselves to face the current of 
        the water. So, if you fit in this category of people, this site is designed for you! Feel free to join our club and your life will be more 
        delighted than ever.

        Typography
    </h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
        Heading Font: Verdana (sans-serif)  <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <p>
        For headings, I want to use Verdana (sans-serif) because of its attractivness mixed to simplicity.  <!-- change this -->
    </p>

    <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Arial (sans-serif)  <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <p>
        Paragraph font will be Arial (sans-serif) to stay inline with the simplicity of the design. In addition, I want the test of legibility to pass with a 100% score.   <!-- change this -->
